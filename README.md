# harvester-site
Web site for Harvester Seasons project at http://harvesterseasons.com/


The site displays maps using Leaflet.js JavaScript library and time series using Dygraph-library. The location of the time series can be chosen by clicking on the map view. Map layers and time series data are pulled from a local SmartMet server's WMS- and Timeseries-plugins. A cloud optimized GeoTIFF layer is added to the map using georaster-layer-for-leaflet -library.

The site is based on code from https://github.com/fmidev/c4e-site
